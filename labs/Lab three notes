Lab three notes
pwd 'print working directory' reveals directory
ls 'list' reveals contents
if you add a single quotation mark, you have to add the other one before anything else will happen. Control-C (control cancel) also works.
tab autocompletes
man (manual) shows the manual for the command following it. Q escapes this. Googling it often works better.
ls -lrth prints details about the directory
head prints the file
cd ../ backs you up a directory layer, and cd ../../ does it twice. Continue ad infinatum.
to return to home directory (your username), cd ~
relative paths go from where you are, ABSOLUTE paths begin at the base of the computer. pwd is absolute. cd/home/users/jwc1076/gen711-811/shell_data/ is absoulte. This will be on the practical.
$ allows you to access variables by going $'variable'
echo prints thing
grep is a text search, similar to cntrl f. keep the thing you're serachign for in quotes. grep "@" fileofinterest. grep '^@' means they must begin with it
> redirects into a file if followed by a file name
ls *fastq will only list those files with fastq in the name
| is the pipe special character. Pretty much the same as in r, combines lines.
wc is word count
less lets you scroll through a file
ls /home/users/jwc1076/gen711/shell_data/untrimmed.fastq/SRR etc lists by absolute path
